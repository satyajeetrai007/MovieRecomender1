Movie Recommender System
## Overview
This project is a Movie Recommender System that uses content-based filtering to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. Content-based filtering recommends items by comparing them to items the user has liked in the past, focusing on the features of the items themselves rather than on other users' behavior.

## Features
Content-Based Filtering: The system uses metadata of movies such as genre, director, actors, etc., to recommend similar movies to the user.
Scalable and Efficient: The recommender system can handle a large number of movies and provide recommendations quickly.
Interactive Interface: An easy-to-use interface where users can input their favorite movies and receive recommendations.
